										<p style="color: white; font-style: italic;">In only the first month of summer in much of the Northern Hemisphere, the records are already tumbling. The Pacific Northwest and Canada are in the grip of an unprecedented heat wave. Major cities such as Portland, Ore., and Seattle broke their all-time records for hottest days by wide margins. Thousands lost power; roads buckled as their asphalt cracked amid the heat.</p>

										<p style="color: white; font-style: italic;">China currently releases more carbon emissions than any other country — leading many to believe it bears the greatest responsibility for climate change. However, the situation is more complex than it seems.</p>

										<p style="color: white; font-style: italic;">The U.S. Defense Department is increasingly considering climate change in its assessments of future threats and challenges. In numerous reports, climate change implications are often characterized as “threat multipliers” -- that is, elements that exacerbate existing trends or instabilities. But there are aspects of climate change that have even deeper implications by changing either the physical geography of particular spaces or their perceived relative significance. Today, we are seeing climate change potentially alter fundamental geopolitical structures, with the Russian Arctic at the forefront. </p>

										<p style="color: white; font-style: italic;">In my first week as the BBC's new Australia correspondent in 2019, a state of emergency was declared in New South Wales. Bushfires blazed and came very close to Sydney.

											The orange haze and the smell of smoke will forever be etched in my memory.
											
											As the country woke to pictures of red skies, destroyed homes and burned koalas in smouldering bushland, the climate change debate came to the fore.
											
											But this wasn't a scientific debate. It was political and it was partisan.</p>

										<p style="color: white; font-style: italic;">Climate change is warping geological time, compressing the time scales of natural processes. In photographs taken around the world, Ian van Coller has documented these shifts, reflected in rocks, sediment, and the shrinking of glaciers. Van Coller collaborates with scientists who annotate his images, pointing out key geological features. He also uses historical photos to show changes, juxtaposing the black-and-white images taken by earlier expeditions with today’s landscapes; peaks once covered in snow are now bare rock.</p>

										<p style="color: white; font-style: italic;">Climate change could wipe off up to 18% of GDP off the worldwide economy by 2050 if global temperatures rise by 3.2°C, the Swiss Re Institute warns.
											Forecast based on temperature increases staying on the current trajectory and the Paris Agreement and net-zero emissions targets not being met.
											Figure could rise to 18% of GDP by mid-century if temperatures increase by 3.2°C in the most severe scenario.</p>

										<p style="color: white; font-style: italic;">NITI Ayog recently released the SDG India Index 2020-21, which highlights the national and state level progress on the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). One of the most important objectives of the SDGs is to end hunger by 2030. The report can be accessed here.

											However, global hunger is inexorably on the rise. The situation is expected to get worse as climate change grips the world.
											
											Here is the relationship between global hunger and climate change in a nutshell.</p>
